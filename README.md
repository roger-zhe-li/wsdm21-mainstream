# Leave No User Behind: Towards Improving the Utility of Recommender Systems for Non-mainstream Users

This is our implementation and experimental data for the paper:

Roger Zhe Li, Juli√°n Urbano, Alan Hanjalic (2021). Leave No User Behind: Towards Improving the Utility of Recommender Systems for Non-mainstream Users. In Proceedings of WSDM '21, Virtual Event, Israel, March 8-12, 2021.

## Environment Settings
We use PyTorch 1.6.0 as the main deep learning framework for implementation. The data analysis relies heavily on pyGAM.



## Example to run the code.
The instruction of commands has been clearly stated in the code (see the parse_args function). 

Run NAECF and DeepCoNN:

python3 test.py --dataset instant_video --coef_u 0.5  --coef_i 0.5  --seed 1992  --batch_size 256  --mode 4

Run MF:

python3 test_mf.py --dataset instant_video --seed 1992  --batch_size 256  --mode 5


### Dataset
We provide three processed datasets: Amazon Instant Video, Amazon Digital Music and BeerAdvocate. The BeerAdvocate dataset keeps users with at least 5 interactions, and sample 25% users in the original dataset.
